 * The competitions this extension can hold rosters for.
 *
 * 🚨 A registry, so an application can add one without editing a file it does
 * not own. Adding a league ESPN already covers is a line, because ESPN answers
 * every one of them in the same two shapes.
 *
 * 🚨 The KEYS deliberately match Picks' registry — `cfb`, `nfl`, `nba`, `mlb`,
 * `nhl` — and the two lists are still separate on purpose. This extension does
 * not require Picks and says so in its README, and the fact each list holds is
 * genuinely different: Picks knows which leagues have FIXTURES, this knows
 * which have ROSTERS. A site running both agrees because the keys agree, not
 * because one reaches into the other.
 *
 * 🚨 An unknown key falls back to college football rather than throwing. A row
 * naming a league that has since been removed is somebody's install, not a
 * programming error.
